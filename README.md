Hello Finalist,

I hope you’re doing well and we’re looking forward to talking with you next week.

For the presentation portion of your interview we’d like you to complete and present on the following task.
Your task is to create an XR measurement tool.

Please create a Unity application that has the following features:

* Ability to place two points into space
* Distance between the two points displayed above line connecting them
* No limit to the number of lines that can be placed
* Controls legend in UI

Extra Credit:

* Make the points movable and update the measurement as the points move

For this task we’re making use of git version control. If used throughout the process git will allow us to see your work.

To get started you’ll need to:

* Open a terminal
* Navigate to the directory in which you’d like to store your work and clone the project with the line below.
* `git clone https://YOURUSERNAME@bitbucket.org/umichdig/xrdeveloperinterview.git`
